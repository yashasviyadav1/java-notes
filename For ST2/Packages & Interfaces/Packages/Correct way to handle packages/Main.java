/* Understanding Packages :- 

    - Collection of related class
    - to group related classes, interface and sub pachages
    Types of pachages 
        - user defined 
        - build in : util, Math, lang, i/o

    - pakage statement must be first statement in the program, even before the import statement
    - package is always defined as a separate folder having the same name as teh package name

    - store all classes in that package folder.
    - All classes of the package which we wish to access outside the package must be declared public.

 
    How to access packages ?

    3 ways :
        1. without using package keyword - create object using 'pack.A = new pack.A()'
        2. using package keyword
        3. importing specific class of the package : import pack.Demo (demo is the class inside package 'pack')

 */

import pack.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]){
        A obj1 = new A();
        obj1.print();
        B obj2 = new B();
        obj2.print();

    }
    
}

/* Output :-

    Working class A
    Working class B
