// we can use 'public' here, but if we do not use it then also its fine, because this is the class where main function is and most importantly we are not inheriting or using this class in any other file (i mean like packages)

        B obj2 = new B();  // since we have included the 'packages for all 3 classes' so no need to use pack.A , pack.B, etc.
